Linked Data Exploration Graph
=============================

An app to navigate interconnections between wiki / wikipedia pages



* Explore relationships between 'known' or given fields of knowledge (or memes) by graphing hyperlinks between given sets of webpages (for example wikipedia).

* 'Track' what emerges at the periphery and 'in between' these known nodes by graphing hyperlinks to other pages from the given set of pages and monitoring how it evolves in time as more resources become available and interlinked on these subjects. 

* Navigate from node to node, entering via any selected point of the graph to discover possibilities and learn from the place the user is at and preferred domains of practice onto new territories. Create navigation paths in complex content.

**Approaching apps or maps**: 

* Wikinodes (http://www.idea.org/WikiNodes.htm) iPad application (mimicking visual thesaurus type of navigation) -this does not provide a graph, is not 'self-generated'.
* Map of Science: http://scimaps.org/maps/map/a_clickstream_map_of_83/detail/
* Interactive Graph of influential thinkers: http://bgriffen.scripts.mit.edu/www/media/json/thinkers/#

**Example of applications**:

* Navigation menu for crowded wikis
* Change and transition learning, innovation > navigating "adjacent possibles"*
* Immediate application: the commons movement & alternatives

**Current tools used**: - use case to navigate alternatives:

* Pearltrees: http://www.pearltrees.com/t/exploring-alternatives/id5509379

* Debategraph: http://debategraph.org/Stream.aspx?nid=214100&vt=bubble&dc=focus
